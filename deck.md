## Bio

**Danielle Eriksen** is an artist and graphic designer turned front-end developer, with a long and winding path in-between... Currently growing her skills as a front-ender with the [New Media Labs](http://newmedialabs.co.za/) team and enjoying every minute of it! Loves learning new things and sharing with others. When not gardening, playing with cats or puzzling out the next problem that needs solving, she dedicates her time and energy to introducing newcomers to Ruby on Rails with the [RailsBridge Cape Town](https://railsbridgecapetown.org/) group, and helps teach and encourage young girls in Tech as part of [Code 4 CT](http://code4ct.com/).

---

**Steve Barnett** works as Front-end developer and User Experience consultant. He loves applying User-Centered Design principles to Front-end development. He‚Äôs a bit addicted to [meetups and community things](https://naga.co.za/community/): you can often find him helping out with [RailsBridge Cape Town](https://railsbridgecapetown.org/), [Cape Town Front-End Developers](http://www.meetup.com/ctfeds/), running a [device lab](http://devicelab.co.za/) session, or at a conference giving a talk or facilitating a workshop. If he‚Äôs not there, he‚Äôs probably crouched in an awkward position in front of something funny-looking, [taking pictures of it](https://www.instagram.com/maxbarners/).
